# UI Clock Changes - User Guide

## What's New

The Pill Assistant panel now includes visual clock displays and sorting options to help you better manage your medications.

## Clock Visualizations

### What They Show
Two circular clocks appear at the top of the Medications tab:
- **12-Hour Clock** (left): Shows times in traditional 12-hour format
- **24-Hour Clock** (right): Shows times in 24-hour (military) format

### Wedge Indicators
Colored wedges extend from the center of each clock to show when medications were taken:
- 🟢 **Green**: Medication taken on time
- 🔴 **Red**: Medication skipped
- 🟡 **Yellow**: Medication snoozed/delayed

### How to Read the Clocks
1. Each clock has hour markers around the edge (1-12 or 0-23)
2. Wedges point to the exact time when each medication was taken
3. Multiple wedges at the same time stack together
4. The clocks update automatically when you take, skip, or snooze medications

## Sorting Options

### Available Sort Modes
Three buttons appear above your medication list:

1. **Next Up** (Default)
   - Sorts medications by next scheduled dose time
   - Shows medications due soonest at the top
   - Medications with no schedule appear at the bottom

2. **A→Z**
   - Alphabetical sorting by medication name
   - From A to Z (ascending)

3. **Z→A**
   - Alphabetical sorting by medication name
   - From Z to A (descending)

### How to Use

## Tips

1. **Check the clocks first** - Get a quick overview before scrolling through cards

3. **Watch for red wedges** - Easily spot skipped medications
4. **Compare clock views** - Some people prefer 12-hour, others 24-hour format

## Troubleshooting

**Clocks appear empty?**
- Clocks only show medications that have been taken/skipped
- New medications won't appear until first action is recorded

**Wedges overlap?**
- Normal when multiple medications are taken at similar times
- Each wedge is 5 degrees wide for visibility

**Sort not working?**
- Make sure you're clicking the button, not just hovering
- Active sort button should be highlighted in blue

**Clocks not updating?**
- Clocks refresh automatically after medication actions
- If stuck, reload the page

## Future Enhancements

Planned improvements:
- Date selector to view historical clock data
- Tooltips showing medication name on wedge hover
- Animation when new wedges appear
- Weekly/monthly clock views
